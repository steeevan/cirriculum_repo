# Teacher’s Edition: Turtle Module & Random Module in Python

### **Objective:**  
- Show students how to create graphical drawings using the **Turtle** module.  
- Demonstrate how to generate random data and shuffle sequences using the **Random** module.

---

## 1. Introduction to the Turtle Module

```python
import turtle

screen = turtle.Screen()   # Sets up the drawing window
t = turtle.Turtle()        # Creates a turtle object
```

**Teacher Tip:**  
- Encourage students to experiment with different Turtle methods (e.g., `forward()`, `circle()`, `color()`).  
- Remind them to keep their code organized (e.g., grouping shape-drawing logic into functions).

---

## 2. Basic Turtle Graphics

```python
t.forward(100)  # Move the turtle forward by 100 units
t.left(90)      # Turn left 90 degrees
t.circle(50)    # Draw a circle of radius 50
```

**Teacher Tip:**  
- Talk about angles and geometry when turning the turtle.  
- Show how loops can be used to draw repetitive shapes (e.g., squares, polygons).

---

## 3. Random Data Generation with the Random Module

```python
import random

random_integer = random.randint(1, 100)  # Random int in [1, 100]
my_list = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
random.shuffle(my_list)                  # Shuffle list in place
```

**Teacher Tip:**  
- Explain how randomization can be used in games or simulations.  
- Emphasize that `shuffle()` affects the list **in place** (it does not return a new list).

---

## 4. Drawing Shapes with Turtle

```python
# Example: Drawing a square
for _ in range(4):
    t.forward(100)
    t.right(90)

# Example: Drawing a colorful star
import random
colors = ["red", "green", "blue", "orange", "purple"]
for _ in range(5):
    t.color(random.choice(colors))
    t.forward(100)
    t.right(144)
```

**Teacher Tip:**  
- Discuss angles for shapes (e.g., 90° for squares, 144° for a 5-point star).  
- Encourage students to try different angles and shapes.

---

## 5. Creating Data Sets with the Random Module

```python
import random

# Generate a list of 10 random numbers between 1 and 100
random_numbers = [random.randint(1, 100) for _ in range(10)]

# Shuffle a deck of cards
suits = ["Hearts", "Diamonds", "Clubs", "Spades"]
values = ["2", "3", "4", "5", "6", "7", "8", "9", "10", "Jack", "Queen", "King", "Ace"]
deck = [(value, suit) for suit in suits for value in values]
random.shuffle(deck)
```

**Teacher Tip:**  
- Use card examples to illustrate permutations.  
- Show how list comprehensions can generate large data sets.

## 6. Exercises and Challenges (With **Solutions**)

Below are the exercises from the student edition, along with **sample solutions** and teacher insights.

### Exercise 1  
**Prompt:** Create a Turtle program that draws a colorful pattern of your choice.

<details>
  <summary>Sample Solution & Explanation</summary>

```python
import turtle
import random

screen = turtle.Screen()
t = turtle.Turtle()
colors = ["red", "blue", "green", "yellow", "purple"]

for _ in range(36):        # Draw 36 segments for a full pattern
    t.color(random.choice(colors))
    t.forward(100)
    t.right(170)          # Adjust angle for an interesting spiral
```

**Explanation:**  
- A loop creates repetition for a spiral-like pattern.  
- We pick a random color each time.  
- `right(170)` is arbitrary—students can experiment with different angles to create unique designs.
</details>

---

### Exercise 2  
**Prompt:** Use the Random module to generate a random password of a specified length.

<details>
  <summary>Sample Solution & Explanation</summary>

```python
import random
import string

def generate_password(length=8):
    chars = string.ascii_letters + string.digits + string.punctuation
    password = "".join(random.choice(chars) for _ in range(length))
    return password

print("Random Password:", generate_password(12))
```

**Explanation:**  
- We combine letters, digits, and punctuation for complexity.  
- `random.choice(chars)` picks one character at a time.  
- `"".join(...)` constructs the final string from the list of characters.
</details>

---

### Challenge 1  
**Prompt:** Write a Turtle program that draws a **complex geometric pattern**.

<details>
  <summary>Sample Solution & Explanation</summary>

```python
import turtle
import random

screen = turtle.Screen()
t = turtle.Turtle()
t.speed("fastest")  # Set speed to fastest for quick drawing

colors = ["red", "blue", "green", "yellow", "purple", "orange"]

for i in range(50):
    t.color(random.choice(colors))
    t.forward(i * 5)
    t.right(98)     # Adjust angle for complex spiral
```

**Explanation:**  
- Multiplying `i * 5` increases the forward distance gradually, creating a spiral.  
- Changing the turn angle (`98°`) leads to a decorative swirl.  
- `t.speed("fastest")` helps avoid long wait times for complex patterns.
</details>

---

### Challenge 2  
**Prompt:** Generate a **random quiz** with questions and answer choices using the Random module.

<details>
  <summary>Sample Solution & Explanation</summary>

```python
import random

questions = [
    ("What is the capital of France?", ["London", "Berlin", "Paris", "Rome"], "Paris"),
    ("Which planet is known as the Red Planet?", ["Earth", "Mars", "Jupiter", "Venus"], "Mars"),
    ("Who wrote 'Hamlet'?", ["Shakespeare", "Charles Dickens", "J.K. Rowling", "Mark Twain"], "Shakespeare")
]

# Shuffle the questions
random.shuffle(questions)

score = 0
for q in questions:
    question_text, choices, correct_answer = q
    print(question_text)
    random.shuffle(choices)  # Shuffle the choices to randomize the order
    for i, choice in enumerate(choices, start=1):
        print(f"{i}. {choice}")
    user_input = input("Enter your answer (1-4): ")
    # Validate input
    if user_input.isdigit():
        user_choice = int(user_input)
        if 1 <= user_choice <= 4:
            if choices[user_choice - 1] == correct_answer:
                print("Correct!\n")
                score += 1
            else:
                print(f"Wrong. The correct answer was {correct_answer}.\n")
        else:
            print("Invalid choice.\n")
    else:
        print("Please enter a number.\n")

print(f"Your final score is {score}/{len(questions)}.")
```

**Explanation:**  
- We store each question as a tuple: (question_text, [choices], correct_answer).  
- `random.shuffle(questions)` randomizes the question order.  
- We also shuffle the answer choices so they appear in a random sequence.  
- Track `score` to count correct answers, then display results at the end.

## Additional Practice Problems (With **Sample Solutions**)

Below are the additional practice problems from the student edition, now with sample solutions and explanations.

### 1. Spiral Drawing
**Prompt:** Use a loop to create a spiral-like pattern with Turtle. Change color randomly after each line.

<details>
  <summary>Sample Solution & Explanation</summary>

```python
import turtle
import random

screen = turtle.Screen()
t = turtle.Turtle()
t.speed("fast")

colors = ["red", "blue", "green", "yellow", "purple"]
for i in range(60):
    t.color(random.choice(colors))
    t.forward(i * 3)   # Increase distance each time
    t.right(45)        # Turn 45 degrees to create a spiral shape
```

**Explanation:**  
- The distance increases in each iteration (`i * 3`).  
- Turning 45 degrees repeatedly forms a spiral-like pattern.
</details>

---

### 2. Turtle Race
**Prompt:** Create multiple turtle objects and make them “race” to a finish line using random movements.

<details>
  <summary>Sample Solution & Explanation</summary>

```python
import turtle
import random

screen = turtle.Screen()
screen.setup(width=600, height=400)

# Create turtles
colors = ["red", "blue", "green", "yellow"]
turtles = []
start_y = -50

for color in colors:
    racer = turtle.Turtle(shape="turtle")
    racer.color(color)
    racer.penup()
    racer.goto(-250, start_y)
    turtles.append(racer)
    start_y += 30

# Start the race
finish_line_x = 200

race_over = False
while not race_over:
    for t in turtles:
        t.forward(random.randint(1, 5))
        if t.xcor() > finish_line_x:
            race_over = True
            winner = t.color()[0]  # Get turtle's color
            break

print(f"The winner is the {winner} turtle!")
screen.mainloop()
```

**Explanation:**  
- Each turtle starts at the same x-coordinate but a different y-coordinate.  
- We randomly move each turtle by 1 to 5 units each loop iteration.  
- The first turtle to cross `finish_line_x` wins.
</details>

### 3. Random List Filtering
**Prompt:** Generate a list of 20 random integers (1 to 50). Filter out numbers above 25.

<details>
  <summary>Sample Solution & Explanation</summary>

```python
import random

random_list = [random.randint(1, 50) for _ in range(20)]
filtered_list = [num for num in random_list if num <= 25]

print("Original list:", random_list)
print("Filtered list (<= 25):", filtered_list)
```

**Explanation:**  
- List comprehension quickly generates and filters the list.  
- Students can practice using conditionals inside list comprehensions.
</details>

---

### 4. Random Password File
**Prompt:** Create a text file containing 5 random passwords of user-specified lengths.

<details>
  <summary>Sample Solution & Explanation</summary>

```python
import random
import string

def generate_password(length=8):
    chars = string.ascii_letters + string.digits + string.punctuation
    return "".join(random.choice(chars) for _ in range(length))

password_count = 5
length = int(input("Enter the password length: "))

with open("passwords.txt", "w") as file:
    for _ in range(password_count):
        pwd = generate_password(length)
        file.write(pwd + "\n")

print("5 random passwords have been saved to passwords.txt.")
```

**Explanation:**  
- Prompt the user for length.  
- Generate each password using a helper function.  
- Open a file in write mode (`"w"`) to save the passwords, one per line.
</details>

---

### 5. Colorful Circles
**Prompt:** Draw multiple circles in random colors, sizes, and positions using Turtle.

<details>
  <summary>Sample Solution & Explanation</summary>

```python
import turtle
import random

screen = turtle.Screen()
t = turtle.Turtle()
t.speed("fastest")
t.penup()

colors = ["red", "blue", "green", "yellow", "purple"]

for _ in range(10):
    t.goto(random.randint(-200, 200), random.randint(-200, 200))
    t.color(random.choice(colors))
    radius = random.randint(10, 50)
    t.pendown()
    t.circle(radius)
    t.penup()

screen.mainloop()
```

**Explanation:**  
- The turtle jumps to random coordinates (`goto(...)`) with `penup()` so it doesn’t draw lines en route.  
- Each circle has a random color and radius, creating a colorful scattered pattern.
</details>
