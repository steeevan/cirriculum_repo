# Lesson Plan: Turtle Module & Random Module in Python (Student Edition)

### **Objective:**  
- Learn to create drawings and graphics using the **Turtle** module.  
- Understand how to generate random data using the **Random** module.

---

## 1. Introduction to the Turtle Module

The **Turtle** module provides a simple way to create drawings and animations in Python. Think of a “turtle” that moves around the screen to draw shapes based on your commands.

```python
import turtle

# Create a screen and a turtle object
screen = turtle.Screen()
t = turtle.Turtle()
```

- `turtle.Screen()` sets up the drawing window.  
- `turtle.Turtle()` creates a turtle you can command.

---

## 2. Basic Turtle Graphics

Use Turtle commands to move the turtle and draw lines, circles, and other shapes.

```python
t.forward(100)   # Move forward 100 units
t.left(90)       # Turn left by 90 degrees
t.circle(50)     # Draw a circle with radius 50
```

Common **Turtle** methods:
- `forward(distance)` or `fd(distance)`
- `backward(distance)` or `bk(distance)`
- `left(angle)` or `lt(angle)`
- `right(angle)` or `rt(angle)`
- `circle(radius)`
- `color(color_name)` (e.g., `"red"`, `"blue"`)
- `penup()` and `pendown()` for lifting/placing the pen.

## 3. Random Data Generation with the Random Module

The **Random** module in Python lets you generate random numbers, shuffle lists, pick random items, and more.

```python
import random

# Generate a random integer from 1 to 100
random_integer = random.randint(1, 100)

# Shuffle a list
my_list = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
random.shuffle(my_list)
```

Common **Random** functions:
- `randint(a, b)`: Returns a random integer between `a` and `b` (inclusive).
- `choice(sequence)`: Returns a random element from a sequence.
- `shuffle(sequence)`: Randomly reorders the elements in a list **in place**.
- `random()`: Returns a floating-point number between 0 and 1.

## 4. Drawing Shapes with Turtle

You can combine Turtle commands to draw complex shapes and patterns.

```python
# Drawing a square
for _ in range(4):
    t.forward(100)
    t.right(90)

# Drawing a colorful star
import random
colors = ["red", "green", "blue", "orange", "purple"]
for _ in range(5):
    t.color(random.choice(colors))  # Pick a random color
    t.forward(100)
    t.right(144)
```

- Here, the loop repeats drawing lines and turning.
- `144` degrees is the turn angle to draw a classic 5-point star.

---

## 5. Creating Data Sets with the Random Module

You can generate random data sets for various purposes, like simulations, testing, or creating mock data.

```python
import random

# Generate a list of 10 random numbers between 1 and 100
random_numbers = [random.randint(1, 100) for _ in range(10)]
print("Random numbers:", random_numbers)

# Example: Shuffling a deck of cards
suits = ["Hearts", "Diamonds", "Clubs", "Spades"]
values = ["2", "3", "4", "5", "6", "7", "8", "9", "10", "Jack", "Queen", "King", "Ace"]
deck = [(value, suit) for suit in suits for value in values]
random.shuffle(deck)
print("Shuffled deck:", deck)
```

## 6. Exercises and Challenges

### Exercise 1  
Create a **Turtle** program that draws a colorful pattern of your choice.  
*Hint:* Use loops, different colors, and shapes to make it visually interesting.

### Exercise 2  
Use the **Random** module to generate a random password of a specified length.  
*Hint:* Include uppercase letters, lowercase letters, numbers, and special characters for a more secure password.

### Challenge 1  
Write a **Turtle** program that draws a **complex geometric pattern**. Try to create something symmetrical or even fractal-like.  
*Hint:* Consider using nested loops and changing the turtle’s color or pen size each iteration.

### Challenge 2  
Generate a **random quiz** with questions and answer choices using the **Random** module.  
*Hint:* You could store a list of questions/answers, then randomly select 5 to create a short quiz.

## Additional Practice Problems

1. **Spiral Drawing**  
   - Use a loop to create a spiral-like pattern with Turtle.  
   - Change the color randomly after drawing each line.

2. **Turtle Race**  
   - Create multiple turtle objects.  
   - Randomly move each turtle forward until one crosses a finish line.  
   - Declare the winner!

3. **Random List Filtering**  
   - Generate a list of 20 random integers between 1 and 50.  
   - Filter out numbers above 25 and print both lists.

4. **Random Password File**  
   - Create a text file containing 5 random passwords of user-specified lengths.  
   - Hint: Use `with open("passwords.txt", "w") as file:` to write to a file.

5. **Colorful Circles**  
   - Write a Turtle program that draws multiple circles of different random colors and sizes in random positions on the screen.

## Vocabulary Words and Definitions

- **Turtle Module**: A Python module that provides tools for creating drawings and simple animations.  
- **Random Module**: A Python module that allows for the generation of random numbers, choices, and shuffling of data.  
- **Shuffle**: To change the order of elements in a sequence randomly.  
- **randint(a, b)**: Returns a random integer between `a` and `b` (inclusive).  
- **Penup()/Pendown()**: Turtle commands to lift/lower the pen (so you don’t draw lines while moving).  
- **Fractal**: A repeating pattern that appears similar at every scale (often drawn using recursion or repeated patterns).
